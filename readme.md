# lambda-js [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dfellis/lambda-js.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dfellis/lambda-js)

## Quick install instructions

For Node.js

    npm install lambda-js

For browsers, just copy ``./lib/lambda.min.js`` (generated by [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS/))and include it in a ``<script>`` tag.

For developers, ``npm test`` to check your changes (using [nodeunit](https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit/)) haven't broken existing functionality. Literate programming documentation can be found inside of the ``/docs`` directory, generated by [docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/).

## Syntactic sugar for lambda one-liners without a performance penalty

Until ECMAScript 6 gives us the fat-arrow syntax for one-liners in functional style evaluation,

```js
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
	.map(x => x*2)
	.reduce((sum, val) => sum + val);
```

Such one-liners include a lot of ugly noise:

```js
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
	.map(function(x) { return x*2 })
	.reduce(function(sum, val) { return sum + val });
```

Javascript allows us to define functions on-the-fly,

```js
var adder = new Function("a,b", "return a+b");
```

And with that capability, and caching already-constructed lambdas so there's no performance penalty beyond the initial construction, we can have nice one-liners even before ES6:

```js
var l = require('lambda-js');

[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
	.map(l("x", "x*2"))
	.reduce(l("sum, val", "sum + val"));
```

Lambdas are "pure" functions, not closures, so the following won't work:

```js
var l = require('lambda-js');
var foo = 'bar';
var impureLambda = l('baz', 'foo + baz'); // Will throw a ReferenceError, foo not defined
```

But pure functions are perfectly predictable because their output is totally determined by their inputs, and the closures where they are defined cannot affect their behavior, so it can also be useful to "scrub" a larger function with lambda-js:

```js
var l = require('lambda-js');
var scrubbedFunction = l(function(foo, bar) {
    var foosin = Math.sin(foo*foo);
    var barrep = bar.replace(/bar/g, 'baz');
    return foosin + barrep;
});
```

Lambda-js attaches a ``pure`` property to the lambdas (with a value of ``true``), which can be used by other libraries to determine if the function they have been provided is a pure function or a closure.

If you need to transmit lambdas over the wire, Lambda-js provides a simple serialization and deserialization mechanism.

```js
var l = require('lambda-js');
var funcObj = l.serialize(function(foo, bar) {
    var foosin = Math.sin(foo*foo);
    var barrep = bar.replace(/bar/g, 'baz');
    return foosin + barrep;
});

var funcObjStr = JSON.stringify(funcObj); // Doesn't throw

var func = l.deserialize(funcObj);
```
