# lambda-js [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dfellis/lambda-js.png?branch=master)](undefined)

## Quick install instructions

For Node.js

    npm install lambda-js

For browsers, just copy ``./lib/lambda.min.js`` (generated by [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS/))and include it in a ``<script>`` tag.

For developers, ``npm test`` to check your changes (using [nodeunit](https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit/)) haven't broken existing functionality. Literate programming documentation can be found inside of the ``/docs`` directory, generated by [docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/).

## Syntactic sugar for lambda one-liners without a performance penalty

Until ECMAScript 6 gives us the fat-arrow syntax for one-liners in functional style evaluation,

```js
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
	.map(x => x*2)
	.reduce((sum, val) => sum + val);
```

Such one-liners include a lot of ugly noise:

```js
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
	.map(function(x) { return x*2 })
	.reduce(function(sum, val) { return sum + val });
```

Javascript allows us to define functions on-the-fly,

```js
var adder = new Function("a,b", "return a+b");
```

And with that capability, and caching already-constructed lambdas so there's no performance penalty beyond the initial construction, we can have nice one-liners even before ES6:

```js
var l = require('lambda-js');

[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
	.map(l("x", "x*2"))
	.reduce(l("sum, val", "sum + val"));
```
